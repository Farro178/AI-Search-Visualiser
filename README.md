This project, A.I search visualiser, is a web application developed to visualise popular search
algorithms used within Artificial Intelligence.
<br />
Nodes and edges are drawn onto a canvas and stored together as elements. The next step is to
select a start and end goal for the algorithm. The user can then select one of four currently available
algorithms to visualise. There are playback controls that allow the user to step through the
visualisation in whichever way they please. The visualisation consists of nodes changing colours to
distinguish between what state they currently are in throughout the algorithm. Users may also wish to
enable comparison between algorithms to understand how they differ from each other by visualising
both simultaneously. There is also an option to save the current arrangement of elements in the
graph, to then upload that save at a later time and reuse the tree. To increase customisation, users
have the ability to edit the heuristic values and names of nodes and edges.
<br />
One goal was to make the web application as simple as possible to use. To achieve this the user
interface is, with every option laid out in front of the user rather than being hidden in menus and
other pages. If at any point the user is confused there is a helpful tutorial that will assist them in
using the tool. This contributes to achieving the main goal of the project, assisting those studying A.I
search algorithms by using custom visualisation and interaction which are tools often used to
understand and learn complicated ideas.
